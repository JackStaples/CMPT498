# Design Document

## User flow

* The user will start by being presented by a map, which has each location of the dual-loops on them. The road will be color
  coded so that they can see delays in real time. 
  
* If the user clicks on an individual location, there will be graphs shown to see the days history of the location. If two or more lcoations are clicked then 
  the user will be able to compare those locations together
  
* The user can also click on one of the locations to see a more in depth history of that location

* There will also be a button for the user to go in and see locations that are sending faulty records, or malfunctioning.

* The user can also go to another screen where a larger breadth of vizualations are available to them, such as a longer history of the month/year as well as other analytics they would like to see.

## UI Elements

* Center of the first screen will be a map of Edmonton, with all of the locations marked on the map and are clickable

* There will be a filter along the side of the screen that can sort certain locations based on pre-defined criteria

* There will be a navigation bar at the top to allow the user to navigate to different parts of the web tool

* There will be a panel on the right side of the map for the different visualization elements
